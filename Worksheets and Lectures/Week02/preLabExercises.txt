    a)  Will include the standard header file from a pre-defined directory.
    b)  Will include your own header files in the current directory.
    c)  Assigns a name to a constant value, eg. wherever LENGTH occurs, it is replaced with 100.
    d)  Allows a small snippet of code to work. Can simply RETURN CUBE instead of calculating it.
    e)  Will take the input numbers and output the result.
    f)  Will only print LENGTH if it has been defined.
    g)  If THEFILE is not defined, then it will be defined, and the function f will be created.

    a)  They are accessible from all functions and possibly across source files. Creates issues with security and coupling.
    b)  Static functions are only used within one file, so declaring them in the header file makes them no longer static.

    a)  main.c includes database.h and util.h
    b)  util.c, interface.c, database.c and main.c include util.h
    c)  main.o  database.o  util.o  interface.o
    d)  main.o  database.o
    e)  util.o  interface.o database.o  main.o
    f)  util.o
