    Missing * to make it a pointer, cannot initialise an integer to NULL.
    Should be int* value = NULL;
1b)
    The pointer must be initialised and given a memory address before it can
    be pointed to a value.
1c)
    The pointer must be initialised and given a memory address before it can
    be pointed to a value.
1d)
    A pointer of type pointer must point towards another pointer. 
    The char** must become char*, or the char ch should become a pointer.
1e)
    A void pointer can be assigned to any data type without type casting.
    The correct code would be:
    
    double value = 42.0;
    void* pointer = &value;
    *pointer = 84;
